										<p>Digitalizing and automating the medical internship unit students’ forms can streamline the administrative process, reduce errors, 
											increase accessibility, enhance security, and promote sustainability.
											<ul style="text-align: left;">
												<li>Certification of Eligibility</li>
											One of the services that have been adapted to be online as a result of COVID-19 pandemic by Medical Internship Unit (MIU) is the 
											eligibility certificate. This certificate must be received by the Saudi Commission for Health Sciences (SCFHS) to allow students to
											 take the eligibility test. This service allows students to request and receive the certificate online as well as it provides MIU to approve and manage 
											 the requests.
											<li>Student Statement Letter</li>
											This is an automated online service that helps students to have their statement letters for academic admissions. The service saves students time and effort. 
											<li>Temporary Certificate With GPA</li>
											Temporary Certificate Form is an online form that allows students to request a temporary certificate from the Medical Internship 
											Unit (MIU) online. Through this e-form MIU can manage requests, approve it and send the certificate via email.
											<li>Outside Rotation Letter for Medical Interns</li>
											Intern Students need to seek an outside rotation letter that allows them to spend their intern rotation in 
											a hospital of their choice. Our Outside Rotation Letter Form helps both Intern Students and the MIU medical intern unit to 
											make the process by providing the needed letter in a short time.
											<li>Medical Internship Leave Request </li>
											During this challenging period due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Medical Internship Unit (MIU) team adapted its approach to provide online services to students. One of these services was medical intern leave request, this project allowed students to request a medical intern leave and the MIU to manage and approve the requests.
